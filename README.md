# Red Flags JavaScript Game ðŸ’Œ

Red Flags is a browser-based quiz game that challenges players to recognize the difference between healthy and unhealthy relationship behaviors. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game presents users with common phrases and situations â€” your goal is to spot the red flags before you run out of chances.
Inspired by a post-breakup coffee chat with a friend, where humor helped us spot the red flags we once ignored.
